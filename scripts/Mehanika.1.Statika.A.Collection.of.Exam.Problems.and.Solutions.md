# Mehanika 1 Statika: A Collection of Exam Problems and Solutions
 
Mehanika 1 Statika is a subject that covers the principles of statics and strength of materials for engineering students. It involves the analysis of forces, moments, stresses, strains, and deformations in various structures and systems. Students who take this course need to master the concepts and methods of solving problems related to equilibrium, stability, internal forces, cross-sectional properties, axial loading, torsion, bending, shear, and buckling.

One of the best ways to learn and practice Mehanika 1 Statika is to work on exam problems and solutions. These problems are designed to test the students' understanding and application of the theory and formulas. They also help to develop the skills of drawing free-body diagrams, resolving forces into components, applying equilibrium equations, finding reactions and internal forces, calculating stresses and strains, and checking the results for accuracy and consistency.
 
There are many sources of exam problems and solutions for Mehanika 1 Statika online. One of them is a PDF document titled "Mehanika 1 (Statika) - Ispitni Zadaci" (Mehanika 1 (Statika) - Exam Problems), which was uploaded by ÐÐµÑÐ°Ñ ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ñ on Scribd[^1^]. This document contains 38 pages of problems and solutions from different exam sessions. The problems cover topics such as force systems, trusses, frames, beams, columns, cables, friction, centroids, moments of inertia, and virtual work. The solutions are detailed and show the steps and calculations involved.
 
Another source is a PDF document titled "ReÅ¡eni ispitni zadaci iz MEHANIKE I (Statika i Otpornost materijala)" (Solved exam problems from MEHANICS I (Statics and Strength of Materials)), which was authored by Katica Hedrih and Ratko PavloviÄ and published in 1978[^2^]. This document is available on eLibrary[^2^], a digital repository of the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Belgrade. It contains 12 chapters of problems and solutions related to statics and strength of materials. The problems are grouped by topic and difficulty level. The solutions are concise and show the formulas and results.
 
A third source is a PDF document titled "Mehanika 1 - Statika" (Mehanics 1 - Statics), which was posted on vdocuments.pub[^3^]. This document contains 10 pages of problems and solutions from various sources. The problems cover topics such as resultant forces, equilibrium, trusses, frames, beams, friction, centroids, moments of inertia, and virtual work. The solutions are brief and show the main steps and calculations.
 
These are some examples of exam problems and solutions for Mehanika 1 Statika that can be found online. They can be useful for students who want to review the material, practice their skills, or prepare for exams. However, they should not be used as a substitute for attending lectures, doing homework assignments, or studying textbooks. Students should also check the validity and accuracy of the information before using it.
