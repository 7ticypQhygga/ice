# Understanding Variability and Sampling in Common Core Algebra 2
 
Variability and sampling are two important concepts in statistics that are covered in Common Core Algebra 2. In this article, we will explain what they mean and how they are related to each other.

## What is Variability?
 
Variability is the measure of how much data values differ from each other or from a central tendency, such as the mean or median. Variability can be caused by different factors, such as measurement errors, natural differences, or experimental treatments. Variability can be quantified by using measures such as range, standard deviation, or variance.
 
## What is Sampling?
 
Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a population for the purpose of collecting data and making inferences about the population. Sampling can be done randomly or non-randomly, depending on the research design and the availability of resources. Sampling can introduce variability due to the randomness of the selection process or the bias of the sampling method.
 
## How are Variability and Sampling Related?
 
Variability and sampling are related because they both affect the quality and accuracy of statistical analysis and inference. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of all students in a school, we can use a sample of students and calculate the sample mean as an estimate. However, this estimate will not be exactly equal to the population mean, because there is variability within the population and within the sample. The difference between the sample mean and the population mean is called sampling error, which is one type of variability that we need to consider when making inferences.
 
To reduce sampling error and improve our estimate, we can use a larger sample size or a more representative sampling method. However, we also need to consider other types of variability that may affect our data, such as measurement error or experimental error. For example, if we use a faulty ruler to measure the heights of students, or if we assign students to different treatment groups that may affect their heights, we will introduce more variability into our data that may distort our estimate.
 
Therefore, understanding variability and sampling is essential for conducting valid and reliable statistical analysis and inference in Common Core Algebra 2.
  
## How to Measure Variability?
 
There are different ways to measure variability depending on the type and shape of the data. One common measure is the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set. The range gives a rough idea of how spread out the data is, but it does not take into account how the data is distributed or how many values there are. A large range may indicate high variability, but it may also be influenced by outliers or extreme values that are not representative of the data.
 
A more robust measure of variability is the standard deviation, which is the average distance of each data value from the mean. The standard deviation tells us how much variation there is around the center of the data. A small standard deviation means that most of the data values are close to the mean, while a large standard deviation means that there is more variation and dispersion in the data. The standard deviation can be calculated by using the formula:
 
$$s=\\sqrt\\frac\\sum(x-\\overlinex)^2n-1$$
 
where $s$ is the sample standard deviation, $x$ is each data value, $\\overlinex$ is the sample mean, and $n$ is the sample size.
 
The standard deviation can also be used to calculate another measure of variability called the variance, which is simply the square of the standard deviation. The variance gives us an idea of how much squared deviation there is in the data. The variance can be calculated by using the formula:
 
$$s^2=\\frac\\sum(x-\\overlinex)^2n-1$$
 
where $s^2$ is the sample variance.
 
## How to Perform Sampling?
 
There are different methods of sampling depending on the research design and the availability of resources. One method is simple random sampling, which means that every individual or item in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Simple random sampling can be done by using a random number generator, a random number table, or a lottery system. Simple random sampling ensures that the sample is representative of the population and minimizes sampling bias.
 
Another method is stratified random sampling, which means that the population is divided into subgroups or strata based on some characteristic, such as age, gender, or income. Then, a simple random sample is taken from each stratum in proportion to its size in the population. Stratified random sampling ensures that each subgroup is adequately represented in the sample and reduces sampling variability.
 
A third method is cluster random sampling, which means that the population is divided into clusters or groups that are geographically or logically close together, such as schools, neighborhoods, or regions. Then, a simple random sample of clusters is selected and all individuals or items within those clusters are included in the sample. Cluster random sampling reduces the cost and time of sampling, but it may increase sampling variability if the clusters are not homogeneous.
